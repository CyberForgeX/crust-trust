# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of **Crust-Trust** pledge to make participation in our project and community a positive experience for everyone. We are committed to creating a harassment-free experience regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

At **Crust-Trust**, we believe in the philosophy of **writing pure Rust code without external crates**. This project aims to show how much can be accomplished with Rust’s standard library. We strive for simplicity, efficiency, and maintainability by avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

## Our Philosophy

The **Crust-Trust** project has a specific vision, and adhering to that is critical. We expect contributors to respect the following principles:

1. **No External Crates**: We do not use or rely on third-party crates in **Crust-Trust**. The focus is on leveraging Rust’s standard library to its full potential. Contributions that introduce external dependencies will not be accepted.
   
2. **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Code contributions should be simple, clean, and efficient. We value well-structured, easy-to-understand code that is maintainable and avoids unnecessary complexity.

3. **Consistency with Project Goals**: Every contribution should align with the original goals of the project—creating a streamlined tool for managing Rust workspaces and dependencies. Contributions that diverge from these goals or add unrelated features will not be accepted.

4. **Respect for Other Contributors**: Constructive feedback, empathy, and understanding are core to building a thriving open-source community. Be patient and respectful of differing experience levels.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Respectful and inclusive language and communication.
- Providing helpful feedback and being open to different viewpoints.
- Staying focused on the project’s philosophy and long-term vision.
- Valuing simplicity and the standard library’s potential.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Using or promoting the use of third-party crates against the project’s philosophy.
- Introducing unnecessary complexity or diverging from the project’s focus.
- Any form of harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior.
- Trolling, insults, or personal attacks.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with the project's philosophy or violate this Code of Conduct, and may ban contributors for inappropriate conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces where contributors represent the project, such as GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **cyberforgex@gmail.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly. We are committed to maintaining confidentiality with the reporter.

## Philosophy-Driven Development

We ask all contributors to fully embrace the project's philosophy:
- Use Rust’s standard library as much as possible.
- Avoid the temptation to introduce third-party crates.
- Prioritize maintainability and clarity over complexity.

The success of **Crust-Trust** relies on keeping it simple and powerful using Rust's own tools, and we expect all contributors to share this vision.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with additional philosophy guidelines tailored to **Crust-Trust**.
