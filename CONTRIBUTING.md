## Getting Started

To get started with contributing, you will need to:

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cyberforgex/crust-trust.git
   cd crust-trust
   ```
3. Ensure you have the latest **Rust** version installed. You can install Rust from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

4. Start working on your changes in the **dev** branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### ðŸš« **No External Crates** 
This project is focused on **writing pure Rust code** without the use of **external crates**. Please do not include any external crates in your contributions. If your change can be made with Rustâ€™s standard library, we strongly encourage you to take that approach. We want to maintain simplicity and avoid dependencies.

### ðŸ“‹ **Stay On-Target**
We ask that contributors keep the project's original goals in mind when contributing. **Crust-Trust** is designed to:
- Manage Rust workspaces efficiently.
- Provide tools to optimize, audit, benchmark, and automatically handle dependencies.
- Not diverge into unrelated features or stray from its intended purpose.

Contributions that deviate from these goals may not be accepted.

### âœ… **Writing Clean Code**
- Follow Rust's coding conventions and idioms.
- Write clear, concise code.
- Ensure code is **well-documented** and easy to understand.
- **Tests are required** for any new features or changes. If you add a feature, include corresponding tests.
- Ensure your code passes all existing tests and does not introduce regressions.

### ðŸš§ **No Unnecessary Complexity**
Please avoid adding overly complex solutions. We value solutions that are easy to maintain, extend, and understand.

## Branch Structure

To streamline development, all work should be done on the **dev** branch. 

1. **dev**  
   Use this branch for all development, including new features, bug fixes, optimizations, and enhancements.

To create and push the `dev` branch:
```bash
git checkout -b dev && git push -u origin dev
```

## Code of Conduct

Be kind and respectful to everyone. Any harassment, hate speech, or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.

## Submitting Issues

If you discover bugs, issues, or have suggestions, feel free to submit an issue in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cyberforgex/crust-trust/issues). Please ensure the issue is clear, with steps to reproduce if applicable.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any new code has been tested locally.
2. Ensure the project builds cleanly using:
   ```bash
   cargo check
   ```
3. Submit a Pull Request (PR) from your fork to the `dev` branch.
4. All pull requests must be reviewed before they are merged.

## Development Workflow

When working on the project:

1. **Start from the latest `dev` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   ```

2. **Isolate your changes** to the feature or bug fix you're working on.
   
3. **Run tests** before submitting a pull request:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. If you add any new files, ensure they fit within the projectâ€™s structure and follow naming conventions.
